# Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-Project
This project involved developing a machine learning-based intrusion detection system with my team, following the CRISP-DM methodology. We used Python and Jupyter Notebook for implementation, conducted data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to identify security threats.
